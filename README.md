EDemeyer2D is a 2D Engine which can be used for simple 2D applications.

It is powered by win32 and Direct2d and includes the following features:
  - Simple dynamic delegates system.
  - Simple 2D collision and overlap detection (work in progress)
  - a Game instance -> Scene -> Object -> Component code hierarchy
  - Automatically cleans up destroyed instances of added components
  - A resource manager that loads bitmaps and only unloads them when they are not in use anymore. Also doesnt load resources more than once.
